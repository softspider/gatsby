## Direct descendants

Yet absent

## Requirements

* [*Node 8.x.x* or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* [*gatsby-cli*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)

Other dependencies are transitive and therefore installed implicitly.

## Installation

Two steps are required:

### Install *gatsby-cli*

Being in any directory, run:

```sh
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

### Generate and Install minimalistic *Gatsby.js* site

All code in this repository are generated and installed at once by the following *gatsby-cli* command.

Being in some parent directory, run:

```sh
npx gatsby new gatsby gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

## Running

Navigate into *gatsby* - new siteâ€™s directory - and start it up

```sh
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at http://localhost:8000.  
There is a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool that can be used to experiment with data
requests.
