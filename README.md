## Installation

Two steps are required:

### Install *gatsby-cli*

Being in any directory, run:

npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

## Install this minimalistic *Gatsby.js* site

Being in this repository directory run:

```sh
npm i
```

## Running

```sh
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at http://localhost:8000.  
There is a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool that can be used to experiment with data
requests.
